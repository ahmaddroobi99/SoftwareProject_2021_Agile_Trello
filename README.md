  E – Wallet Project

1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the e-Wallet System and describe the files and code that has been developed for the same. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system.


1.2. Scope of Project
This system will be an e-Wallet designed for use by the students of Palestine. The main objective is to provide the students/vendors at Palestine a simple software that will enable easy, secure payment at all of the outlets available on campus and therefore facilitate a new technology-driven means by virtue of which, every student can do away with the burden of having to worry about carrying cash around campus for various needs.

Currently, some of the issues brought out by the students include the fact that they do not receive change in cash, on making purchases at most outlets on campus. Added to this is the problem of most students having to wait for a long time to get the bill settled after a small purchase. Even worse are scenarios where the outlet owners are robbed of their money when the students manage to get away without payment when there is a huge rush. The e-Wallet system has the potential to solve all of these issues if implemented across campus.

Currently, the system is designed for usage only by students of Bits Goa. Further additions could be made to the system to make this facility available to any on-campus resident, say, staff members, wardens, hostel assistants, etc.

1.3. Glossary


e-Wallet

The software component that handles the payment and associated data and provides the user( in our case, a student) with options to make payments, recharge and avail loyalty benefits provided by the vendors.

Student

Refers to the students at Bits Goa. More specifically, any person with access to the outlets at Bits Goa who has an SWD account maintained at the campus and is identified by a unique ID number provided by the campus.

* Database
Collection of all the information, i.e., payment logs, credit balances and dues, account balances and registered student information is monitored by this system.

* Vendor
Person/outlet on campus who(which) receives the payment from the students when a purchase is made by them.

* Payment tracker
A system which facilitates the secure payment process by interacting with the student and the database and the vendor.

* Loyalty benefit
Special offers made by outlets on campus to students who make purchases from their outlets using the e-Wallet system.

* Logs
Refers to data that indicates the proceedings of various transactions between the student and the vendor. In a way, they behave as a sort of proof of payment.

* Account
Refers to the unique account maintained for each registered student which comprises a security pin, balance amounts, unique name and id.

* Recharge
Recharge here, is used to refer to the transfer/translation of money from the student’s swd-account to e-Wallet cash, which the student can use at the various on-campus outlets.

* User
The term user has been used along with the term Student in this document. In all cases both terms refer to a student as described above.

## Learning Process 
**Experts in software architecture and design are highly paid, because they know how to create designs that are flexible, elegant, and reusable.
**You become an expert through experience, reusing solutions that worked for you before.
**Patterns describe solutions to design problems that occur over and over again.
**Patterns also record design decisions, alternatives, and trade-offs gained from experience.
**Once you know the pattern, many design decisions follow.
**Knowing patterns helps you get designs right faster.
**Knowing the vocabulary surrounding patterns helps communication between designers, and can ease the documentation effort.

## Stakeholders: 
each one involved in the project, and it includes: 
1)Customer.
2)Developers.
3)Users.

Lessons  :
a) Positives

	> The whole experience of meeting new people and developing something together had the sort of feel we beleive a company would offer.
	> Learnt a lot from our evaluator(Anubhav Chaturvedi) who helped us in improving the overall manner in which we were supposed to write and present the software.
	> The majority of the group pitched in with ideas in the design stage.
	> Learnt the importance of working as a group.
	> Handled submission deadlines positively and were focused on doing the best we could at all times.
	> Continuously pushed ourselves to improve and perfect whatever we had already built.
	
b) Negatives
	
	> Not everyone was well-versed with github.
	> The need to physically meet up to discuss and alot work and deal with issues was felt although there were provisions to do the same online.

c) What would we do differently the next time?
	
	> Try coding up the basic code structure in the initial few days.
	> Use GitHub and Specification docs more than we did this time around, to improve overall contribution from everyone.
